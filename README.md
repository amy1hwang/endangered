This endangered specieds map is a map displaying overlaid images of 10 endangered species along with their details.

Here are the requiments when creating the page.
1. Choose at least 10 species total. Try to include every continent. This site should prove helpful.

2. On a new webpage, set up a div with a class of “map” and place a blank world map image into it. I recommend using this world map example, but you’re welcome to find another.

3. You will also need a fixed masthead or overlayed header so users know what they’re looking at.

4. Using Google, search for images of the endangered species you’ve chosen. I recommend using .JPEG files for performance, but for higher resolution photos you’ll want to use .PNG. Needless to say, resizing may be necessary. But tread carefully! It is worth noting that using CSS to resize large photos often take longer to download than necessary. One quick workaround would be to download and resize photos using an image editing tool like Pic Monkey, then adding the image into your project folder.

5. Position these images on the map according to the region of the world they are found in. Remember, they must not move out of place if the window is resized. This doesn't mean it should be responsive, it's only to show whether you're using absolute and relative positioning together properly.

6. Add labels to each species. Include their common name (e.g. “Siberian Tiger”), their scientific name (e.g. Panthera tigris altaica), as well as population statistics.

7. Incorporate at least one pseudo-element on the page. Experiment with content or effects.

8. Style up the details! Be creative and explore other properties such as box-shadow, linear-gradient, or a pseudo-class like :hover.
